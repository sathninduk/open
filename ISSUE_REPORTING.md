# Issue Reporting Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Open Knowledge Base repository. If you've encountered an issue, have a suggestion, or would like to report a problem, please follow these guidelines to help us address it effectively.

## Issue Types

- **Bug Report:** If you've identified a problem or unexpected behavior in the repository, please provide a detailed description of the issue, including any relevant steps to reproduce it.

- **Feature Request:** If you have a suggestion for a new feature, enhancement, or improvement, describe it clearly and explain the context in which you believe it would be valuable.

- **Question:** If you have a question related to the repository's content, usage, or any other aspect, feel free to ask. Check the existing issues to see if your question has already been answered.

## Reporting an Issue

1. **Check Existing Issues:** Before creating a new issue, please search the existing issues to ensure that a similar one hasn't been reported already.

2. **Create a New Issue:** If your issue hasn't been reported, you can create a new issue. Click on the "Issues" tab above, then click the "New Issue" button.

3. **Issue Title:** Provide a clear and concise title that summarizes the issue or request.

4. **Description:** In the issue description, please provide as much detail as possible. This could include steps to reproduce a bug, examples illustrating your feature request, or context for your question.

5. **Labels:** Apply relevant labels to your issue, such as "bug", "enhancement", or "question". This helps categorize and prioritize issues.

6. **Assignees:** If you have a specific person in mind to address your issue, you can assign them. Otherwise, the main contributor (sathninduk) will address it.

7. **Screenshots or Code Snippets:** If applicable, include screenshots or code snippets to better illustrate the issue.

## Issue Discussion

Be prepared to engage in discussions related to the issue you've reported. Maintain a respectful and constructive tone, and provide any additional information that might help clarify the problem or contribute to a solution.
